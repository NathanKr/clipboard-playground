<h2>Motivation</h2>
I have contact tab on www.nathankrasney.com with my email. I want the user to click it so it will be copy to the clipboard and he can use it in email

<h2>Points of interest</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am using react but the support of js ion clipboard is in javascript via navigator so it can be used also outside of react</li>
</ul>
